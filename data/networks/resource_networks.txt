Mammal Networked Information System	MaNIS	With support from the National Science Foundation, seventeen North American institutions and their collaborators developed the Mammal Networked Information System.  The original objectives of MaNIS were to 1) facilitate open access to combined specimen data from a web browser, 2) enhance the value of specimen collections, 3) conserve curatorial resources, and 4) use a design paradigm that can be easily adopted by other disciplines with similar needs.	http://manisnet.org/	http://manisnet.org/manis_banner3.JPG
