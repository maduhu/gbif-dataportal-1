<p>Welcome to the Data Portal of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).  For an introduction to the capabilities of the Portal, see the <a href="tutorial">online tutorial</a>.

<p>GBIF is an international organisation that is working to make the world's biodiversity data accessible everywhere in the world. GBIF and its many partners work to mobilise the data, and to improve search mechanisms, data and metadata standards, web services, and the other components of an Internet-based information infrastructure for biodiversity.</p>

<p>GBIF makes available data that are shared by hundreds of data publishers from around the world.  These data are shared according to the <a href="datauseagreement">GBIF Data Use Agreement</a>, which includes the provision that users of any data accessed through or retrieved via the GBIF Portal will always give credit to the original data publishers.</p>
