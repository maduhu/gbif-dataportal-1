<p>Occurrence records can be found using the <strong>Occurrence search</strong> (see <a href="occurrence">Searching for occurrences</a>).  In the tabular view offered by the Occurrence search, there is a <strong>View</strong> link shown to the right of each record.  This link opens the <strong>Occurrence detail</strong> view, which in turn offers a link to retrieve the original record directly from the publisher's web site.</p>


<h5>Step-by-step guide</h5>

<ol type="1"><li> Perform a search using the <a href="occurrence">Occurrence search</a> and then select the option to <strong>View records as table</strong>.
</li><li> Click on the "View" link at the right of a table row to see the <strong>Occurrence detail</strong> view for that record. A new page will open, showing 
<ol type="a"><li> many of the original values supplied by the data publisher, 

</li><li> an interpretation of some of these fields to make it possible to search for records across all datasets, and 
</li><li> notes on apparent discrepancies within individual records (e.g. inconsistent country and coordinates).			
</li></ol></li><li> There may be a "Warnings" box at the top of the page.  This will note any apparent discrepancies within the record, and may highlight that some important data elements, such as basis of record, are not available or could not be interpreted automatically by the portal.
</li><li> The information for the record is displayed under a series of subheadings:
<ol type="a"><li> Dataset - metadata on the original record and any specimen it represents.  This section contains all identifiers associated with the record and provides links back to the pages for the data publisher and dataset.  It also displays the "Basis of record".  This indicates what the data publisher is using to show that the organism did occur at the time and place indicated (e.g. the basis of record is a specimen held in a collection, or an observation or fossil).  The portal shows both the original information supplied by the data publisher as the basis for this record (e.g. "S") and how the portal has interpreted that value (e.g. "interpreted as Specimen").  If the portal has not been able to interpret the value, or no value is supplied, the basis of record appears as Unknown.
</li><li> Taxonomy - information on the identification associated with the record, including the species or group of organisms to which it is assigned, and any information supplied by the publisher on higher classification.  In each case the portal displays the original information from the publisher and offers a link to the overview pages that show the species or group of organisms with which the portal has associated the record - this is particularly significant in cases in which there are multiple organisms with the same name or the classification supplied by the data publisher differs significantly from that used by the portal.  This section also includes information on the person who identified the organism (if any was included by the data publisher).
</li><li> Geospatial - information on the location and date of the occurrence.  The portal again displays both the information retrieved from the data publisher and the interpretation of that information by the portal.  If the record has coordinates, a Google Map view is also shown for the location.  This section also includes any information on the collector or observer  (if this was included by the data publisher).
</li></ol></li><li> At the bottom of the page there are several links, including one that  retrieves the original record from the data publisher (this may contain additional information, or may possibly have been modified since it was indexed by the portal) and options to find related records.</li></ol>
